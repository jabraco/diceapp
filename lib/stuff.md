good morning

tim cook.mp4

so, my intention for today's meeting was to talk a bit about this year and then touch on some ios/ app stuff for next year

i've prepared slides so i don't forget anything, but we can do it informally, talk about things - up to you

anything from you before i begin?


alright, so starting with just a high level reminder of what i've done this year

- first half of the year was dedicated towards a big project, latter half smaller bits and bobs
- i like the variety of not being chained to one big project for so long

i'll expand more on november training stuff in more detail in a bit, for the monthly recap

i dont intend for future monthly recaps to be like presentations, but just doing that for now as i have other stuff to show

# november


I fixed a few crashing bugs with the app mid november that reduced crashes by 80%. 99% uptime.



impact on advertising:

s0 since advertising the app, we;ve seen 200% increase in user acquisition and 128% the income, directly  correleated to sharing the app on socials

my recommendation therefore is to advertise the app permanently in the socials banner as well as making it more prominent on the site

state of the app (money):

here are the stats for the app. we;re getting roughly 20 paid users a month. if this was a $2 subscription instead of of a one time fee, and 30% of the current paid users would sub, then it would exceed patreon's first tier users

my thinking is that for £2 one time fee we're selling it off for too cheap compared to the amount we can make from it


# app projections



I’ve been doing some number crunching on the impact a subscription model, and ios apps would have, here are my findings

assuming again 30% of users pay recurring $2, we would 2x monthly revenue and increase eoy funds by 70%

on ios, making an ios app with the current stats, we can expect a conservative estimate of 1.5x android, although given that roughly 40% of our userbase is ioS already, that number is probably a lot larger in reality

also, the fallout administrator has an iphone and personally asked for an ios app

merging the two looks like this. suddenly a lot more serious. also, these projections only cover uesp -  if we do the same for starfield and fallout, i am expecting not just 4x of company revenue but of apps too


# im summary

focus for 2024 should be getting stuff in place for fallout, legal wise and server wise.

personally i recommend advertising the app more prominently across socials and site, as well as thinking about changing legal name to be more generic between wikis
